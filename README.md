This is built using RubyMine.  Free 30 day trial is enough to see if this project lives anyways, assuming
we cant get our license.  

I installed ruby 2x64 and the devkit for x64.  

I created an empty project in rubymine and added an app.rb.  Hopefully shank has a better idea of whats up. 


Lets not abandon this one, like all the others?
